The settings apply to experiments that are created from this folder,
started with the script found here. If you want to apply other settings,
copy asrt.py and the inst_and_feedback.txt file containing the instructions to a
to another directory, and you can enter the desired other settings when starting that script.

The settings can be changed by deleting the settings/settings file; at the same time the file
deletion is not recommended due to later transparency. If you still decide to delete,
