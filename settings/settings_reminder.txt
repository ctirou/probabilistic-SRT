The settings apply to experiments that are created from this folder,
started with the script found here. If you want to apply other settings,
copy asrt.py and the inst_and_feedback.txt file containing the instructions to a
to another directory, and you can enter the desired other settings when starting that script.

Make sure that you always start the script from the directory where it is suitable for you

The settings can be changed by deleting the settings/settings file; at the same time the file
deletion is not recommended due to later transparency. If you still decide to delete,
